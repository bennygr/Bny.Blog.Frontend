		This is just a simple blog for keeping my personal notes about software development & CO.
		It is based on my very simple, puristic, rudimentary and self-made blog-engine <a href="http://github.com/bennygr/bny/"><i>bny.blog</i></a>, which 
		makes it very easy to publish posts and articles written in markdown using your favorite editor of choice.
