		<h2>hashlib++</h2>
		<p>
		I started <i>hashlib++</i> in 2007 as a simple and very easy to use wrapper library to create cryptographic checksums in C++. Over the years alot of projects made use of <i>hashlib++</i>, where <i>Bohemia Interactive's <a href="http://www.arma2.com/">ARMA II</a></i>  is probably the most popular. <i>hashlib++</i> is written in plain C++ and should work with every compiler and platform. The library is released under the BSD-license and therefore free software.

		<h2>noised</h2>
		<p>
		<i>noised</i> is a music player daemon, which allows you to turn your computer into a music jukebox. The project is still in a very early stage and under active development.
